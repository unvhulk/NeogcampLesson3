          <h1>DISCIPLINE EQUALS FREEDOM</h1>
          <small>December,2021</small>
          <p>
            What is freedom? It might seem to an unsuspecting eye that we have
            freedom to do what we want and in a we do, but observing some more
            reveals that there are many more factors at work here. Our brain is
            looking to reduce the energy cost regularly and hence it develops
            patterns. These patterns or routines helps us reduce the processing
            of information so that we can use it somewhere far more suitable. As
            the time goes on, these repeating routines become habits. Habits are
            actually what shapes our life. Any skill , mastery over any crafty
            can be traced to consistent habits, but it works for the destructive
            patterns as well. Since our mind compulsively always seeks comfort
            and easy oxytocin which also releases dopamine which is the
            "craving" drug , feeding in the habit loop of cue , action and
            reward. Coming back to our question of freedom, habits dictate most
            of the people's lives.They are not choosing to do something
            'consciously' rather they are compelled by their own mind to act in
            such ways.Mind are supposed to be our tools however we are being
            controlled. The keyword here is consciously.If we can control our
            habits consciously then we can be said to be in control but we
            cannot even control the always ongoing chatter of the mind. Most of
            us mistake compulsiveness with freedom, yet it is nothing but going
            through patterns set by our own minds, there is no choice.What is
            real freedom then? It is absolute control. Absolute control of one's
            own mind.Control can only be achieved by discipline. By doing what
            is necessary not what feels easy.Mind always wants to take the easy
            way out yet nothing can be done in comfort. A ship is safest on the
            dock but its meant to sail.

          <h1 class="hero hero-heading">What is God?</h1>
          <small>December,2021</small>
          <p>
            In this blog I will go into the conceptualization of God by human
            beings.There are plethora of religions scattered on the planet right
            now.Many have risen and many have fell.Many are continuing into
            their struggle of supremacy of their God and their God is the only
            one, so much shackled by the believes integrated into their identity
            that they are unable to question anything objectively. There are
            various concepts of God that humans have held.One conceptualization
            of God is being the King of the world,owner of everything.But this
            concept seems to be incomplete as when we enquire that if he is the
            owner then who was the owner before him? If he was the owner from
            the start then who created them? Then the idea comes forth that he
            is the creator and omnipotent, the all powerful.But then the
            question rises if he is all powerful then why doesn't he stop the
            wrong doers? Why sinners florish and the good suffer? The answer
            given is that everyone suffers from the results of their actions.
            They claim cause and effect but if God is all powerful then why let
            anyone do wrong? Why allow bad people to exist? And if you observe
            every conceptualization till here is only the extention of human
            beings. A very powerful man ,very powerful woman, of different
            color,race, etc. with many hands and so on.Now there are some which
            go beyond this too. That which is beyond body , mind and senses and
            causes of all and effect of all is God. He is the ocean and we are
            just waves. He is the clay,we are the pot.Now this is a very
            interesting idea, just see, if we take clay away from pot does the
            pot remain? If we observe closely there was never a pot, it was only
            the clay. The pot is just a name given to a specific appearance of
            the clay.If you take out Gold from Gold necklace, there remains no
            necklace. Everything is just God, nothing else exists.Nothing else
            can exist and everything is just an appearance of God.Good and Bad,
            yin and yang are all appearances in the ocean.It's all appearance
            all unreal.Here unreal doesn't means false, it means it exist but we
            have superimposed something on the reality making it unreal.This
            idea of God encompasses every concept of God in it.
